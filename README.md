# navigation tfjs prototype

Basic prototype of tensorflow js machine learning model used to navigate a basic react component using facial expressions.

This demo is limited to navigating up and down along tabIndexes, left and right within a slider and clicking on buttons.

This model was based of the tensorflow pacman app but has been extensively re-written with a functional approach and using newer browser api's.
